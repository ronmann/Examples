Man Drinks 20 Red Bulls and Goes Crazy
This happened a while back, but still makes us laugh serves as an example.

48 year old Peter Edwards was caught “swerving from side to side” across the road. The police had trouble stopping him – he overtook their car and almost rammed into a truck. He was eventually stopped using a “stinger device” that punctured his tires.

Edwards was later tested and found to be free of any alcohol and drugs.

It turns out he had consumed 20 cans of Red Bull. By the sounds of it, he had been drinking these over the duration of a whole night. By our calculations thats about 1.6 grams of caffeine – still a long way off from a lethal dose – but enough to make you go crazy.
